To move a piece, enter the Tile coordinate of its top-left tile.
Then enter W to move up, A to move left, S to move down, or D to move right

Due to time constraints, the game itself is unwinnable, as the player's special car
was being very fincky, and was not implementable. In addition, color-coding was equally
fincky and bugged so it to oreamins unimplemented. Finally boundary contraints, such
as no intersecting of cars or no driving off of the board, were unimplemented due to
time contraints.

Other than those three things, the game, Rush Hour, is completely playable, and enjoyable.
